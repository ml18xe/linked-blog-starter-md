## Production 2: Foundations

Though the Marone reading barely touches upon the concept of 'gamification', the Nolan & McBride reading describes the concept to be a mere marketing strategy that makes use of superficial game features (badges, achievements, rewards, etc.) as incentives to harness the engagement and motivational qualities of games for non-gaming purposes (i.e. education). These superficial game features are referred to as a 'game-layer' to be simply overlayed atop the non-gaming content as per the gamification process. Although among the most profitable of sectors, gamification barely scratches the surface of the engagement and motivational possibilities that games possess due to a lacking of intrinsic motivators and other deeper-level game features that the 'game-layer' does not account for.

DGBL, in contrast, is a different sector that seeks to bring technology integration into the classroom in an attempt to better promote collaboration, problem-solving, communication, experimentation, and the exploration of identities. However, like gamification, DGBL also struggles to integrate powerful intrinsic motivators and deeper-level game features, primarily focussing on the superficial, extrinsic features, as more than that has been deemed unfeasible to integrate into classroom and curricular settings. As a result, it also fails to achieve its initially expected results.

Regarding gamification and its tension with the many theories of play and what play really is, I would like to explore an excerpt from the Nolan and McBride reading:

> "Play is first of all assumed to be pleasurable and enjoyable, to be characterized by freedom and spontaneity, and to elicit active (as opposed to passive) engagement by players. Second, it is generally assumed that play is unproductive and without ‘real’ consequence in life – its motivations are said to be intrinsic as opposed to extrinsic." (Nolan & McBride, 2014, 600)

To address the first point in the quote, in regards to gamification, perhaps the concept of the 'game-layer' is enough to elicit the required pleasure and enjoyment for some players depending on how superficially oriented they are. However, I would not particularly deem it as characterized by freedom and spontaneity, as gamified material is still material bound by the constraints of its underlying non-game content and real life goals. To address the second point in the quote, gamification definitively does not assume unproductiveness nor intrinsic motivation, as the whole purpose of gamification is to gamify productive content, and the concept of the 'game-layer' itself is fully extrinsic in nature. Thus, I would not describe gamified gameplay as play under this description.

Another excerpt on play from the Nolan and McBride reading:

> "play \[is] freely chosen, personally directed and intrinsically motivated. Freely chosen play means that children choose when and what play they undertake, play is not part of a curriculum or a programme and does not have steps that need to be completed. When play is personally directed, it is children themselves who agree the roles or rules of the activity, as well as the outcomes, if any." (Nolan & McBride, 2014, 600)
 
Under this description, engaging with gamified material definitely would not fit with play, as nothing about gamification speaks to this definition of it being freely chosen. Gamified material is entirely curricular (whether the curriculum is explicitly made clear or not) and certainly requires steps to be completed (learning goals, etc.).

In regards to my personal experience with gamification, there was a time where I was really interested in learning how to read sheet-music. Although I had already learned the basics of it, I was still a very slow reader, so I downloaded a game on my phone that was supposed to help me with that ([[#Figure 1 Sheet Music Sight-Reading Game for iPhone|see Figure 1]]). This game essentially gamified reading sheet-music by placing a game-layer where you were given a score based on speed and accuracy. The goal was to read as many of the displayed notes as you could within one minute and to try to aim for a new high score everyday. You could also share and try to beat your friends' scores through Game Center (though I had no one to share it with).

It was not a fun game. It felt almost like studying flash cards if anything. At first, I found enjoyment in the fact that my score was gradually improving, however, I eventually reached a point where I found myself obsessing over making sure I get a new high score every day. This is where it started to become frustrating. At this point, my scores were so high that I was spending hours playing the game over and over again trying to achieve a high score. It came to the point where I would even reset as soon as I made a mistake, without even completing the full one minute. Getting a high score became so time-consuming and focus-intensive that it eventually began to feel like a chore and I lost all motivation to keep playing. I can no longer sight-read.
