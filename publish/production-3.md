## Production 3: ‘Hands-On’ Play Theory / Games Theory

Although placed in the reading merely as a prelude to the main discussion on categories and dimensions of games, I would like to quote Cailliois's diverse qualities of what permits an activity to be defined as play (Cailliois, 1959, 128):

> 1. **Free:** in which playing is not obligatory; if it were, it would at once lose its attractiveness and joyous quality as diversion;
> 2. **Separate:** circumscribed within limits of space and time, defined and fixed in advance;
> 3. **Uncertain:** the course of which cannot be determined, nor the result attained beforehand, and some latitude for innovations being left to the player's initiative;
> 4. **Unproductive:** creating neither goods, nor wealth, nor new elements of any kind; and, except for exchange of property among players, ending in a situation identical to that prevailing at the beginning of the game;
> 5. **Governed by rules:** under conventions that suspend ordinary laws, and for the moment establish new legislation, which alone counts;
> 6. **Make-believe:** accompanied by a special awareness of a second reality or of a free unreality, as against real life.

While I agree with most of the qualities listed above, I do not agree that an activity necessarily be unproductive in order to be defined as play. For one, learning is productive and can occur through play. If things are learned, then goods, wealth, and new elements can be created as a result of said learned material. Thus, play can indeed be (if not always) productive. Surprisingly, I feel as though education was barely touched on, if at all, throughout the Cailliois text. 

And another point on productivity, Cailliois later lists *the hobby* as a form of play (a form of *ludus*, which he explains "stands for a specific element in play" (Cailliois, 1959, 145)). Hobbies, in effect, can create goods that can oftentimes be sold and generate wealth. It can be argued that once a hobby begins to produce goods that generate income, it may no longer be considered a hobby, but rather, a job. However, even under that definition, who is to say that your job cannot be play? As long as it is carried out under circumstances that are free, separate, uncertain, etc., I do not see why a generation of income prevents it from being considered play.

And lastly, I am a little bit sceptical on the statement that play necessarily be governed by rules. This is only because, earlier in the text, Cailliois outright claims that "Many games do not imply rules" (Cailliois, 1959, 126), and rather, it is the fictional element of this type of play that replaces the function of rules. Thus, it seems a little bit contradictory to state that an activity require both to be governed by rules AND be make-believe in order to be defined as play.

My scepticism on that last point aside, for the purposes of this production, the game in which I have chosen to play and discuss is the game Minecraft, as I feel that it qualifies under all of Cailliois's listed qualities of play except for **4. Unproductive**, as I do not stand for that one. 

To begin the discussion, I would like to bring up Cailliois's four fundamental categories of games. Throughout my gameplay experience in Minecraft, I have felt that it had corresponded with all four game categories: agôn, alea, mimicry, and ilinx. As Minecraft has the unique trait of offering the experience of "a game of many games", this is not surprising. I will elaborate further.

Firstly, agôn, the category that reflects competition, I felt corresponded with many of the PVP (player versus player) mini-games in Minecraft that I had played against my friends. In these PVP circumstances, we are given challenges where we are all pinned against each other rather than co-operating. My favourite of these mini-games was one called Sprint Racer, which is essentially a Mario-Kart-like racing game that takes place on foot in a race-track built in Minecraft.

Something particularly of note about the Sprint Racer mini-game was that, although I noticed some elements of agôn, alea, mimicry, and ilinx sprinkled throughout Minecraft overall, just Sprint Racer alone seemed to encompass all four categories in itself: 

For alea, the category that reflects chance, Sprint Racer provides Mario-Kart-like item boxes that you can pick up through the race, offering randomized abilities that can range from extremely useful to totally useless.

For mimicry, the category that reflects simulation, playing Sprint Racer, we are all pretending to be avatars in Minecraft who are pretending to be Mario-Kart race carts on a race track, despite actually being on foot for some reason (it is totally feasible for race carts to be added to the game. The choice to be on foot was most definitely not due to programming restriction, but rather, for comedic/amusement purpose).

And lastly, for ilinx, the category that reflects vertigo, in Sprint Racer, the fast-paced, first-person nature of the game, in combination with all the crazy jumps, drops, and roller-coaster-like loopty-loops, evoked an immersive feeling of high-speed intense motion. Furthermore, one of my friends decided to play the entire time with a VR headset on (despite us warning him that it would make the game harder) and ended up left with a headache and a bad case of motion-sickness.

As for where Sprint Racer falls within the spectrum of paidia and ludus, I am unsure. While paidia refers to the free, spontaneous manifestations that occur in some forms of play, ludus refers to the difficult, challenging, and obstacle-based conflict that occur in other forms of play. However, I find myself feeling as though Sprint Racer reflects both of them equally, which is absurd because, in the text, paidia and ludus are represented as total polar opposites.

As for if, how, and what was learned throughout my experience in Sprint Racer, I am also unsure. Perhaps improving my hand-eye coordination and dexterity, reaction time, and predictive mapping capabilities to anticipate turns and jumps in advance counts as learning, although, I would probably describe that more as practicing than learning. I did learn that VR headsets can cause motion sickness however.
