## Production 7: Critical Play

### Option 1: PLOG-ING — Playing Twines or Other Games / Analyzing a Game(s) using ‘Critical Play’

I have chosen to analyze the Twine game [Wayfarer](https://idrellegames.itch.io/wayfarer) by Idrelle Games, simply because it far exceeded my expectations on what Twine games could do.

Wayfarer is a text-based RPG that takes place in a world run on magic. Though there are a vast number of character customization options available to choose from in the beginning of the game (gender, ancestry, place of origin, etc.), the player always plays from the POV of a person within a small and heavily discriminated minority of people who were born unable to use magic: the "Wayfarers". The journey begins after the player is cast away by his family as a child for being a 'lack-magic', and sent off to train with the Wayfarer warriors. Many obstacles occur along the way, and the choices you make eventually determine the outcome of the plot, but the main premise of the game is to overcome the living conditions, struggles, and prejudice involved with being of a minority group born with lesser capabilities compared to the rest of the world. The difficulty raises even further as the group of Wayfarer warriors grow extinct and the player ends up one of the only remaining Wayfarers left, taking on scrap mercenary jobs just to stay alive.

According the Flanagan, games as art are a means of expression in which artists, "manipulate elements common to games—representation systems and styles, rules of progress, codes of conduct, context of reception, winning and losing paradigms, ways of interacting in a game" (Flanagan, 2009, 4). As such, I feel that Wayfarer qualifies as a work of art in this context, particularly due to the character representation system in place. In order to carry out the plot, the game did not need to provide such an intricate character customization system, as the player always ends up a magicless Wayfarer anyway. They could have just had the player play as a preset Wayfarer boy from a farm and it would have worked out either way. However, I believe these customization options were an artistic choice that takes a common customization paradigm found in many RPG games and uses it to demonstrate the difficulties and discrimination that come with having a disability, regardless of your gender, sexuality, ancestry, appearance, etc.

Furthermore, the game has a system in place to develop skills and attributes for your character as the journey progresses. These traits give you actual gameplay advantages along the way and determine whether or not you survive various obstacles. Depending on the choices you make, you could end up with exceptional strength and perception, or become super agile and persuasive. You can even become known as a battle master. Yet, regardless of what you do, you still end up treated like a lesser being just because of your disability to use magic, even after becoming more powerful than any magic user.

In regards to Flanagan's text, though executed by abstract means, I would consider this artwork a critical game that contributes intervention, more specifically, an Activist Game. According to Flanagan, activist games are, "games that engage in a social issue through, most commonly, themes, narratives, roles, settings, goals, and characters; and less commonly, through game mechanics, play paradigms, interactions, or win states to benefit an intended outcome beyond a game’s entertainment or experiential value alone." (Flanagan, 2009, 13) Although the social issues involving the difficulties of being lack-magic only exist within the fictional world depicted by the game, I still feel that it indirectly sheds light on experiences that can be found in the real-world. To achieve this, not only is this being demonstrated through the narrative, but even gameplay mechanics that the player depends on to advance though the game are incorporated into the intervention.
