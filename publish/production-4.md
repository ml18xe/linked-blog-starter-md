### Option 2: Create a New Chapter

**Chapter 21 > Trust**

While some of the earliest videogames of the multiplayer variant undertake a more competitive tone, with examples such as _Tennis for Two_ (1958) and _Pong_ (1972), the emergence of the ability for players to collaborate with one another has opened the doors to a vast number of possibilities in games. Ranging from early multiplayer games, such as _Pong Doubles_ (1973) and Atari's _Fire Truck_ (1978), all the to way to the team shooters (i.e. Call of Duty) and MMO games (i.e. World of Warcraft) seen today, the mode of co-operation in videogames completely changes the entire experience and underlying properties of the overall gameplay.

One particularly difficult obstacle faced by those who play co-operation games that happens to be lacking in traditional player-vs-player competitive games is Trust. The need to be able to believe in other players, rely on their strength, count on them to be committed, and trust that they are on your side. These are challenges that you will simply not have to deal with in a strictly competitive setting, as they are not crucial to the game objectives in the same way. In fact, if anything, competitive games can be found to be much easier for the player when other players are _not_ strong and _not_ committed, since the other players are _not_ on their side.

However, just as in reality, social interaction is not always going to be a matter of everyone for themselves, and with the extensive simulation capabilities that videogames can provide, it would be a real shame if they neglected to represent this large area of interaction undertaken by those in the real world, despite the added difficulty it may weigh onto players. Videogames allow people to role-play in a variety of scenarios, under a variety of different identities. One category of those scenarios is of the variant where players take on the identity of a team-player where trusting others is a required asset to progress through the game. 

For instance, in many search-and-destroy games, players role-play as a team of soldiers with the goal of infiltrating an enemy base to detonate a bomb at the designated bomb-site. It is not necessary for all soldiers on the team to reach the bomb-site, as only the player who has the bomb can deliver and detonate it. The role of the other players on the team is then to take the offensive and ensure that the soldier with the bomb can smoothly infiltrate the enemy base and not get killed before that happens. With all that said, mutual trust is crucial for the team to succeed, as the soldier carrying the bomb needs to be able to depend on the rest of the team to cover him so that he can attempt to infiltrate. Likewise, the rest of the team needs to be able to depend on the carrier to effectively do his job or they would be fighting on the front lines for nothing and should have assigned a different carrier.

Another example. In many MMORPGs, players role-play as a party of adventurers on a journey consisting of many large monsters to defeat along the way. A common archetype is the fighter-mage-healer party where each member has their own unique role in combat. The exact combat arrangement varies among different groups of players, but oftentimes, the fighter will be relied on to endure damage for the team and distract the enemy with a volley of quick, low-damage strikes so that the mage has time to charge up a destructive, high-damage magic attack. The healer will be relied on to keep the fighter alive so that the enemy does not go after the mage in the midst of charging up. With all that said, mutual trust is crucial for the team to succeed, as the party members need to be able to depend on each other's roles in order to carry out their own role. Though having a party and utilizing trust is not the only way to succeed in such games, as many fighters have been known in the past to 'solo' entire journeys all on their own, trust is at least something offered as a tool in these games and can be beneficial to players if used effectively.

In all, building, encouraging, and providing a simulated space and context for Trust is something that videogames do. Videogames can be used as a team-building tool to strengthen bonds and grow trust between team members. They can also be used as a lesson to provide exposure and enlightenment to some on what it means and how important trust can be as an asset. In a social context, they can be used within a group of friends for someone to demonstrate their competence to others and prove how useful, dependable, and trustworthy they can be when placed under a relatively demanding role. The possibilities for Trust are endless and it goes to show how many uses there are for videogames and what can be learned through play.
