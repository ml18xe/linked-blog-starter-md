### Game Design Project Proposal: No more than 1 page (MAX!)

#### Tools and Technology:

I would like to create a game within the game Minecraft. I plan to use a mix of modding APIs (Forge or Fabric) to create my own mods for the game (programming in Java), as well as a variety of open-source resources (other peoples’ mods) and assets (landscapes, buildings, textures) found on the CurseForge creative commons. I may incorporate Minecraft’s built-in programming language as well (command-blocks, data-packs), and most definitely will be constructing the game environment using in-game building tools (creative mode). In a sense, I will be using Minecraft as my ‘game engine’ for this project.

#### Rationale:

I plan to eventually use Minecraft in this way for my MRP anyway, so Professor Baljko and I concluded that it would be helpful if I could use this project as an exercise to practice my Minecraft modding and curating skills. I have done similar work in Minecraft before, but not yet to the scale of an entire project. By the end of this project, I assume that some of my work will be reusable for my MRP and could be easily copied over. Seeing that education is the focus of my MRP, I feel this course project is quite compatible.

#### The Aim of the Game – or What will your game “do”: 

Through my experience playing Minecraft for several years, I have noticed two recurring areas of activity that are quite often eagerly undertaken by players in Minecraft and I have always felt that those activities would be well-suited for educational purposes. I call these two areas ‘Learning’ and ‘Practice’. 

**Learning:** In many scenarios in Minecraft, especially in modpacks, I have observed players spending hours of undistracted focus reading in-game books on lore and complex theoretical material within the game-world, as well as carrying out experiments and tinkering with game objects to verify what they have read. In this way, new knowledge is learnt and understood enough to complete a desired goal (for example, the ritual to summon a final boss), and then this knowledge ceases to be returned to ever again and is lost, but is relearnt much easier the next time the player does choose to return to it. Learning such material would normally be considered a hassle or ‘too much work’ in other contexts, but for some reason in Minecraft it is felt to be worthwhile.

**Practice:** In other scenarios in Minecraft, I have observed players spending hours repeating rote tasks that, of course, require prerequisite knowledge of the mechanics beforehand (requires 'Learning' first). However, through this, speed and accuracy of the task incrementally improve, memory and faster recall of the steps are acquired, the material becomes further understood, and players eventually obtain a mastery of the skill, enabling them to execute it unconsciously when needed (for example, crafting the same thing so often that the recipe becomes memorized). Practicing such tasks over and over again would normally be considered a waste of time or 'too repetitive' in other contexts, but for some reason in Minecraft it is felt to be worthwhile.

These two areas of activity, 'Learning' and 'Practice', would most closely match the acts of ‘Work’ (somewhat) and ‘Drill’ in Bogost’s literature, demonstrating that the prevalence of these activities have been well observed and documented in games for quite some time. What I would like to do is attempt to create a miniature adventure game in Minecraft that utilizes these activities, but involves academic topics and skills somehow that can be useful in the real world (that can also be easily demonstrated and understood by an audience, e.g. early algebra), without eliminating all the excitement that comes with Minecraft. Of course, it will be heavily downscaled for this project (maybe two or three levels in a bordered-off section of the game world), but I plan to expand it much further in my MRP.

## Production 5: Game Sketch

In regards to Gee's six *features of games with high learning potential*, I would like to discuss each of them and how they speak to the game I propose.

1. Video games can create an embodied empathy for a complex system.

My game will take place within a completely fictional, fantasy-world narrative. Castles, dragons, demons, you name it. Like most games with a narrative, players will often, all on their own, develop an empathy for the game world and take on the perspective of the protagonist within, regardless of the developers' intent. Thus, my game will not really be introducing anything special in this regard. However, since my game will be interconnected by a system of academic topics, the empathy they feel might further their motivation to learn and better understand these topics because they constitute the foundation of how the game-world operates.

2. They are simulations of embodied experience and preparations for action.

Something that has always bothered me about the real world is the lack of opportunity to apply learnt academic knowledge in daily life. Sure, being able to calculate the parabola of a bullet may be handy for a sniper or a forensic analyst, but I am neither of those things and becoming one is way far off in a distant future. What video games provide instead is a fictional world where the material you learn along the way actually does have applications all around. In my game, I believe I can achieve the same thing with academic material, so long as it takes place in a fantasy world where applications are present.

And I do not need to limit myself to plot orchestration either (e.g. simply making the protagonist so happen to be a sniper so that he ends up under circumstances where he needs to calculate a parabola). Rather, since this is a fantasy world, I have the freedom to completely fabricate the properties of the world to make academic material actually more important in daily life (e.g. calculating the parabola of a rainbow always guides you to a distant pot of gold). This could be seen by some as making up 'fake' reasons to be interested in the topic when I should be introducing players to interesting real-life applications instead. Though there are many benefits to sticking to the ladder approach (such as getting players thinking about their future career choices), I feel that it would limit my creative options and be a waste to not use all of the world-building capabilities that videogames possess.

3. They involve distributed intelligence via the creation of smart tools.

Since I am introducing a variety of activities in the game involving academic concepts, it might take forever for the player to sequence through them all if every step involved had to be done manually by the player (e.g. having to learn how to operate a canon in order to shoot it). Rather, I feel it would help reduce the cognitive burden for the player if the character could act as a specialist that understands how to act on behalf of the player (e.g. character already knows how to shoot the cannon, but just needs the player to calculate and input the trajectory).

4. They create opportunities for cross-functional affiliation.
5. They allow meanings to be situated.
6. They can be open-ended in ways that encourage a melding of personal and social goals.

It seems I am already way over the word count. I would have liked to go through all the rest of Gee's *features of games with high learning potential* as well his *four features of a good game*, however, this will have to suffice. Though I doubt addressing every single one of Gee's principles was the point of this production, I will say that I agree with all of them and believe they can all be implemented seamlessly into my project.
