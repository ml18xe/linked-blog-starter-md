### Game Design Project Proposal: No more than 1 page (MAX!)

#### Tools and Technology:

I would like to create a game within the game Minecraft. I plan to use a mix of modding APIs (Forge or Fabric) to create my own mods for the game (programming in Java), as well as a variety of open-source resources (other peoples’ mods) and assets (landscapes, buildings, textures) found on the CurseForge creative commons. I may incorporate Minecraft’s built-in programming language as well (command-blocks, data-packs), and most definitely will be constructing the game environment using in-game building tools (creative mode). In a sense, I will be using Minecraft as my ‘game engine’ for this project.

#### Rationale:

I plan to eventually use Minecraft in this way for my MRP anyway, so Professor Baljko and I concluded that it would be helpful if I could use this project as an exercise to practice my Minecraft modding and curating skills. I have done similar work in Minecraft before, but not yet to the scale of an entire project. By the end of this project, I assume that some of my work will be reusable for my MRP and could be easily copied over. Seeing that education is the focus of my MRP, I feel this course project is quite compatible.

#### The Aim of the Game – or What will your game “do”: 

Through my experience playing Minecraft for several years, I have noticed two recurring areas of activity that are quite often eagerly undertaken by players in Minecraft and I have always felt those activities would be well-suited to be utilized for educational purposes. I call these two areas ‘Learning’ and ‘Practice’. 

**Learning:** In many scenarios in Minecraft, especially in modpacks, I have observed players spending hours of undistracted focus reading in-game books on lore and complex theoretical material within the game-world, as well as carrying out experiments and tinkering with game objects to verify what they have read. In this way, new knowledge is learnt and understood enough to complete a desired goal (for example, the ritual to summon a final boss), and then this knowledge ceases to be returned to ever again and is lost, but is relearnt much easier whenever the player does choose to return to it. Learning such material would normally be considered a hassle or ‘too much work’ in other contexts, but for some reason in Minecraft it is exciting.

**Practice:** In other scenarios in Minecraft, I have observed players spending hours repeating rote tasks, of course, requiring prerequisite knowledge of the mechanics beforehand (requires 'Learning' first). Through this, speed and accuracy of the task incrementally improve, memory and faster recall of the steps grow evident, the material becomes further understood, and players eventually obtain a mastery of the skill, enabling them to execute unconsciously when needed (for example, crafting the same thing so often that the recipe becomes memorized). Practicing such tasks over and over again would normally be considered boring or overly-repetitive in other contexts, but for some reason in Minecraft it is exciting.

These two areas of activity that I have described would most closely match the acts of ‘Work’ (somewhat) and ‘Drill’ in Bogost’s terms, as the prevalence of these activities have been well observed and documented in games for quite some time. What I would like to do is attempt to create a miniature adventure game in Minecraft that utilizes these activities, but by incorporating academic topics and skills somehow that can be used in the real world (basic demonstrative material, e.g. early algebra), without eliminating all the excitement that comes with Minecraft. Of course, it will be heavily downscaled for this project (maybe two or three levels in a bordered-off section of the game world), but I plan to expand it much further in my MRP.
