## Production 8: Cultural Studies of Games

### Option 3: Go back to Zimmerman

Though I, more or less, agreed with most of Zimmerman's statements (particularly those to do with the prevail of computer systems and networks in modern communications), there is one claim right at the beginning of the manifesto that I was skeptical about. However, after all the literature I have read throughout the course, coming back to the Zimmerman reading, I have found that perhaps my doubts have been settled. Either that, or the course has made me even more confused.

**Games are ancient.**

> "playing games is part of what it means to be human." (Zimmerman, 2013, 1)

Sure, games may be everywhere, and sure, games may have been around forever. But to go as far as to state that playing games is part of what it means to be human? That is quite a bold claim. Are we, then, not human if we do not play games? What is it about games that defines who we are? Who are we then without games?

Through the reading of Caillois, there were some passages from the work, _Homo Ludens_ (1938), by J. Huizinga, that provide some insight.

Though Caillois has his doubts about some of Huizinga's claims, the work describes the contributions of play, in that, play has had an important "role in the very development of civilization" (Caillois, 1959, 123), that can be found "present in or animating the essential aspects of all culture." (ibid.) 

Understanding that civilization and culture are phenomena particularly fundamental, both presently and historically, to the human kind, I am willing to accept the idea that play is part of what it means to be human, considering the contributions that play has had toward those phenomena. That being said, it does not speak toward playing *games* specifically, but instead, just *play* itself. But is there a difference between *play* and *playing games*? Does play not always refer to playing games? What even is a game? 

Throughout the course, something that had been pointed out to me that I was not aware of prior is that, even to this day, what actually defines as a game is still unclear. There are many definitions that all conflict with one another, and no one, regardless of what they believe, truly knows what a game really is. That being said, there was a passage in the course about what games are that provides some insight. Though it is not an all encompassing definition, it does speak to a subset of games that, I feel, can be found throughout the history of play among humans: 

> "Reduced to its formal essence, a game is an activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context. A more conventional definition would say that a game is a context with rules among adversaries trying to win objectives." (Abt, 1970, 6)

I would argue that this concept of adversaries within a limiting context making decisions to try to achieve their objectives has always played a crucial role in much of the development of human civilization and culture. And I am not simply talking about chess and checkers. Disputes, politics, war, all of these agreements and disagreements have shaped what civilization and culture is today. Would that not all count as having been playing games? If so, then playing games is certainly what it means to be human. If not, then I have been confused by the readings and need to go back and review them again.
